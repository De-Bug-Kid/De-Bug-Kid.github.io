                <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                <p>I am a conscientious, smart-working bachelor of engineering graduate with a 2nd class honours degree in Mechanical Engineering.<br> I’m currently working with Generation and the Prince’s Trust to develop myself and open my career prospects to the technology industry, specialising in cloud technologies.<br> My current ambition is to become a solutions architect for a reputable company that will enable me to reach my career aspirations and beyond within the next five years.
                </a></p>
            
                <p>
                    Recently, I have undertaken a 12 week-long bootcamp aws re/start, which has introduced to me the fundamentals of Python, Linux, Querying with SQL and Amazon Web Services.
                    <br>
                    I have also just achieved an AWS Cloud Practioner Certification and aim to be working my towards Associate Solutions Architect Certification.
                    <br><br>
                    I am currently working with Code Nation to further develop my IT skills by introducing HTML and CSS into my repository with a website design project.<br>
                    To further sharpen my skills with Python, I, along with a team of three completed a project to create a simple text-based adventure game accessible through GitHub.
